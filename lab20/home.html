			<h1>Development Career</h1>
			<p>My introduction to computer programming began around 2008. My english teacher introduced the class to a website builder and i found it fascinating you could make your own website. Able to self format your own images and text I immersed myself in the features but instead of being satiated with the availabe systems I grew hungry for more customization and understanding of how a webpage functioned. Eventually i discovered the WordPress blogging platform and its theme and plugin systems were exactly the features i had been searching for. Soon after, CJ Solutions became my first attempt at a portfolio or resume for my skills. The following years of junior and then senior high primarily i spent developing WordPress pages for friends online and offline, family, and extracircular programs within school. This led to projects that introduced me to other languages like PHP and mySQL. And the Adobe suite specifically photoshop, flash, and dreamweaver. As time further went on, more confident in my skills as a web developer I ventured out to market my skills to any busines willing to give me a shot at real work. And so in 2012 I founded Permafrost Web Solutions. Since then i have seen many obstacles of the life as a freelance developer both positive and negative. The experiences have taught me how much confidence sells, how closing the gap in skills and knowledge is the key to being paid your worth, and in time with dedication to a project you can only grow into a better developer. Also how much I really love software development! I have put building projects under Permafrost on hiatus, but look forward to what I develop in the future once I am ready to return with a greater understanding of coding. </p>

			<h1>Hometown</h1>
			<p>My mother an IT wiz and father, shade tree mechanic and builder. Along with the brilliant mentors met along my journey, I firmly belive Michigan is home to some of the greatest minds when it comes to technologies and sciences!</p>
			<p>Detroit, Michigan the home of Techno, Motown, and the Automtovie Industry! (Mopar or NO CAR)</p>
			<p>Hard times hit the city after the events during the 1960's and only now in 2018 are we starting to see real change in a positive direction. Especially the families that have been here since that era.</p>
			<p>Some may say its too slow or not enough. Yet I am confident things will continue to change for the better. However, only with everyone holding each other accountable and playing a role in the improvment of our neighborhoods and schools.</p>
			<p>I have lived in Detroit, MI my whole life along with several of its suburb cities throughtout my childhood.</p>
			<p>I attended Southfield Senior High School, Southfield, MI where I majored in Engineering & Manufacturing Technologies.
